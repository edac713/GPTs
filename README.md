# Custom GPTs

ChatGPT now supports "Custom GPTs" which package a custom system message, various modalities to supoort it, and pre-filled files for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

> [!WARNING]
> "GPTs" use a separate model (`gpt-4-gizmo`) with its own usage limit. That message limit is **shared between all "Custom GPTs"**, and has a 32k context size.
>
> _While editing a Custom GPT, this limit does not apply (as of this commit)._
