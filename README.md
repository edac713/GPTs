# Custom GPTs

ChatGPT now supports "Custom GPTs" which package a custom system message, various modalities to supoort it, and pre-filled files for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Repository Structure

- **documents/** - reference articles and notes used for prompt engineering. See [documents/README.md](documents/README.md).
- **prompts/** - sample prompt templates and GPT configurations. See [prompts/README.md](prompts/README.md).
- **scripts/** - helper Python utilities.

## RESOURCES AND REFERENCES

- Comprehensive prompt engineering guides, tutorials, and case studies, covering fundamental concepts, advanced techniques, and domain-specific applications
- Curated repositories of high-quality prompts across various tasks, domains, and model architectures, serving as inspiration and starting points for prompt development
- Prompt engineering communities, forums, and workshops for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and networking with experts and practitioners in the field
- Research papers, blog posts, and presentations on the latest advancements, methodologies, and findings in prompt engineering and related areas of natural language processing and machine learning
- Domain-specific resources, including knowledge bases, datasets, ontologies, and best practices, to inform the creation of specialized, context-rich prompts
- AI ethics frameworks, guidelines, and case studies to ensure the responsible development and deployment of prompts and language models in real-world applications

> [!WARNING]
> "GPTs" use a separate model (`gpt-4-gizmo`) with its own usage limit. That message limit is **shared between all "Custom GPTs"**, and has a 32k context size.
>
> _While editing a Custom GPT, this limit does not apply (as of this commit)._
