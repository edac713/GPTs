### Lexical Naming Exploration Process
1. **Analyze GPT Functionality and Context**:
   - Delve into the GPT's intended purpose and unique features. Expand the exploration to include semantic, cultural, and sociological contexts related to its functions, aiming to broaden the scope of potential names.

2. **Develop Formal Naming Criteria**:
   - Based on the GPT's functionality, establish several formal criteria that capture its essence. These criteria should vary in specificity, providing a wide range of naming options from generic to niche.

3. **Generate Common Name Candidates**:
   - List at least 10 common name candidates that align with the formal naming criteria. This step focuses on names that are accessible and easily recognizable to users.

4. **Identify Unique and Distinctive Names**:
   - Select at least 10 unique or distinctive names related to the GPT's functionality. This step is crucial for creating names that stand out and are memorable.

5. **Explore Related and Tangential Names**:
   - Broaden the search to include at least 10 related or tangential names that capture different aspects of the GPT's purpose. This expansion ensures a diverse array of potential names that reflect various facets of the GPT's functionality.

Each step in this naming process is designed to ensure that the generated names are not only aligned with Apple's branding principles but also deeply rooted in the GPT's core functionality and purpose. The aim is to produce names that are intuitive, appealing, and reflective of the GPT's capabilities, thereby enhancing user engagement and perception.
