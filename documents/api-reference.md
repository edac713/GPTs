# Introduction

You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language, via our official Python bindings, our official Node.js library, or a [community-maintained library](/docs/libraries/community-libraries).

To install the official Python bindings, run the following command:

```bash
pip install openai
```

To install the official Node.js library, run the following command in your Node.js project directory:

```bash
npm install openai@^4.0.0
```

## Authentication

The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your [API Keys](/account/api-keys) page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.

**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

All API requests should include your API key in an `Authorization` HTTP header as follows:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Organization (optional)

For users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count as usage for the specified organization.

Example curl command:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Organization: YOUR_ORG_ID"
```

Example with the `openai` Python package:

```python
`1
2
3
4
5
`from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  organization='YOUR_ORG_ID',
)
```

Example with the `openai` Node.js package:

```javascript
`1
2
3
4
5
`import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  organization: 'YOUR_ORG_ID',
});
```

Organization IDs can be found on your [Organization settings](/account/organization) page.

## Making requests

You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace `$OPENAI_API_KEY` with your secret API key.

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
     "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.7
   }'
```

This request queries the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model (which under the hood points to a [`gpt-3.5-turbo` model variant](/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo)) to complete the text starting with a prompt of "_Say this is a test_". You should get a response back that resembles the following:

```json
{
    "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1677858242,
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 13,
        "completion_tokens": 7,
        "total_tokens": 20
    },
    "choices": [
        {
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "\n\nThis is a test!"
            },
            "logprobs": null,
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "index": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

Now that you've generated your first chat completion, let's break down the [response object](/docs/api-reference/chat/object). We can see the `finish_reason` is `stop` which means the API returned the full chat completion generated by the model without running into any limits. In the choices list, we only generated a single message but you can set the `n` parameter to generate multiple messages choices.

## Streaming

The OpenAI API provides the ability to stream responses back to a client in order to allow partial results for certain requests. To achieve this, we follow the [Server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) standard.

Our official [Node](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) and [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) libraries handle Server-sent events for you. In Python, a streaming request looks like:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

In Node / Typescript, a streaming request looks like:

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

async function main() {
    const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
        stream: true,
    });
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
        process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
    }
}

main();
```

#### Parsing Server-sent events

Parsing Server-sent events is non-trivial and should be done with caution. Simple strategies like splitting by a new line may result in parsing errors. We recommend using [existing client libraries](/docs/libraries) when possible.

## Audio

Learn how to turn audio into text or text into audio.

Related guide: [Speech to text](/docs/guides/speech-to-text)

## Create speech

input

string

Required

The text to generate audio for. The maximum length is 4096 characters.

voice

string

Required

The voice to use when generating the audio. Supported voices are `alloy`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, and `shimmer`. Previews of the voices are available in the [Text to speech guide](/docs/guides/text-to-speech/voice-options).

response_format

string

Optional

Defaults to mp3

The format to audio in. Supported formats are `mp3`, `opus`, `aac`, `flac`, `wav`, and `pcm`.

speed

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

The speed of the generated audio. Select a value from `0.25` to `4.0`. `1.0` is the default.

### Returns

The audio file content.

Example request

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "input": "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.",
    "voice": "alloy"
  }' \
  --output speech.mp3
```

## Create transcription

post https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes audio into the input language.

### Request body

file

file

Required

The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.

model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. Only `whisper-1` (which is powered by our open source Whisper V2 model) is currently available.

language

string

Optional

The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) format will improve accuracy and latency.

prompt

string

Optional

An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The [prompt](/docs/guides/speech-to-text/prompting) should match the audio language.

response_format

temperature

number

Optional

Defaults to 0

The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use [log probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability) to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.

timestamp_granularities\[\]

array

Optional

Defaults to segment

The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: `word`, or `segment`. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

### Returns

The [transcription object](/docs/api-reference/audio/json-object) or a [verbose transcription object](/docs/api-reference/audio/verbose-json-object).

## Chat](/docs/api-reference/chat)

Given a list of messages comprising a conversation, the model will return a response.

Related guide: [Chat Completions](/docs/guides/text-generation)

## Create chat completion](/docs/api-reference/chat/create)

post https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

### Request body

messages

array

Required

A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_format_inputs_to_chatgpt_models).
<button>Show possible types</button>

model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. See the [model endpoint compatibility](/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

frequency_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

logit_bias

map

Optional

Defaults to null

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

logprobs

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`. This option is currently not available on the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model.

top_logprobs

integer or null

Optional

An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

max_tokens

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat completion.

The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens.

n

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

presence_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

response_format

object

Optional

An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.
<button>Show properties</button>

seed

integer or null

Optional

This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

stop

string / array / null

Optional

Defaults to null

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

stream

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

top_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

tools

array

Optional

A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.
<button>Show properties</button>

tool_choice

string or object

Optional

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that function.

`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.
<button>Show possible types</button>

user

string

Optional

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

function_call

Deprecated

string or object

Optional

Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.

`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.

## Completions
Legacy](/docs/api-reference/completions)

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions along with the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position. Most developer should use our [Chat Completions API](/docs/guides/text-generation/text-generation-models) to leverage our best and newest models.

## Create completion
Legacy](/docs/api-reference/completions/create)

post https://api.openai.com/v1/completions

Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters.

### Request body

model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models/overview) for descriptions of them.

prompt

string or array

Required

The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.

best_of

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return – `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

echo

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion

frequency_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

logit_bias

map

Optional

Defaults to null

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

logprobs

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to null

Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.

max_tokens

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 16

The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the completion.

The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens.

n

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

How many completions to generate for each prompt.

**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

presence_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

seed

integer or null

Optional

If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.

Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

stop

string / array / null

Optional

Defaults to null

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

stream

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

suffix

string or null

Optional

Defaults to null

The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

top_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

user

string

Optional

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

### Returns

Returns a [completion](/docs/api-reference/completions/object) object, or a sequence of completion objects if the request is streamed.
